# Introduction

Welcome to my SQL Portfolio Project, where I explore the data employment landscape with an emphasis on positions related to data analysis. This study is an investigation into the highest-paying positions, in-demand talents, and the points where high demand and high salary converge in the data analytics industry.

View my SQL queries here: [project_sql folder](/project1_sql/).

# Background
My goal to gain a deeper understanding of the job market for data analysts was the driving force behind this research. To narrow down and improve the effectiveness of my job search, I set out to find out which talents are in high demand and pay the highest. 

Luke Barousse's SQL Course provided the data for this analysis (https://lukebarousse.com/sql). Details on job titles, pay, locations, and necessary abilities are all included in this data.

## With my SQL queries, I aimed to provide answers to the following questions:

1. What positions pay the most for data analysts?

2. What qualifications are needed for these high-paying positions?

3. What abilities are data analysts most in need of?

4. Which competencies are linked to increased pay?

5. In order to optimize employment market worth, what are the best skills a data analyst may acquire?

# Tools I used
For this research, I conducted my analysis using a range of tools:

- **SQL** (Structured Query Language): Made it possible for me to communicate with the database, extract insights, and formulate queries that addressed my main concerns.

- **PostgreSQL**: I was able to store, query, and manipulate the job posting data using PostgreSQL as the database management system.

- **Code for Visual Studio:** I was able to administer the database and run SQL queries with the assistance of this open-source development and administration platform.

# The Analysis
Each query for this project aimed at investigating specific aspects of the data analyst job market. Hereâ€™s how I approached each question:

### 1. Top Paying Data Analyst Jobs
To identify the highest-paying roles, I filtered data analyst positions by average yearly salary and location, focusing on remote jobs. This query highlights the high paying opportunities in the field.

```sql
SELECT
    job_id,
    job_title,
    job_location,
    job_schedule_type,
    salary_year_avg,
    job_posted_date,
    name AS company_name
FROM
    job_postings_fact
LEFT JOIN company_dim ON job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id
WHERE
    job_title = 'Data Analyst'
    AND salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
    AND job_location = 'Anywhere'
ORDER BY
    salary_year_avg DESC
LIMIT 10; 
```

- **Analytical Thinking**: Mastering the capacity to convert practical inquiries into meaningful SQL queries with illuminating responses.

### **Insights**

From the analysis, several general insights emerged:

1. **Top-Paying Data Analyst Jobs**: The highest-paying jobs for data analysts that allow remote work offer a wide range of salaries, the highest at $650,000!
2. **Skills for Top-Paying Jobs**: High-paying data analyst jobs require advanced proficiency in SQL, suggesting itâ€™s a critical skill for earning a top salary.
3. **Most In-Demand Skills**: SQL is also the most demanded skill in the data analyst job market, thus making it essential for job seekers.
4. **Skills with Higher Salaries**: Specialized skills, such as SVN and Solidity, are associated with the highest average salaries, indicating a premium on niche expertise.
5. **Optimal Skills for Job Market Value**: SQL leads in demand and offers for a high average salary, positioning it as one of the most optimal skills for data analysts to learn to maximize their market value.


# Conclusions
This project enhanced my SQL skills and provided valuable insights into the data analyst job market. The findings from the analysis serve as a guide to prioritizing skill development and job search efforts. Aspiring data analysts can better position themselves in a competitive job market by focusing on high-demand, high-salary skills. This exploration highlights the importance of continuous learning and adaptation to emerging trends in the field of data analytics.
